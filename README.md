# tago-playerbox.js

The simplest and dependency free Youtube modal player.

## Install

Download it from the repository and get the files from the dist folder. (Bower and npm will be available soon)

## Getting Started

Add the following script after referencing the css and js files:
`window.tago.playerbox.init('#play-button', 'youtubeVideoId', 'path/to/loading.gif');`

And that's it. You're ready to go.

## Limitations
This is a work in progress, so there are limitations such as using it only once in the same page.
